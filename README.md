# Operating System from scratch

This is a hobby project aimed to build minimal operating system from scratch aimed to be a learning resource for everyone. 

It is entirely based on [Operating system in 1000 lines](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/) and inspired by several other project such as [Starina](https://starina.dev/) and [Xv6 for RISC-V](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv).

Every part of the code will be documented and will be availible on the upcoming days. Star the project for updates.
